Red Herring
These aren't formats you're looking for.

Herring is a small webrunner based on Rack. Herring is intended to stream Ruby created documents requested via HTTP without first needing to write a normal file to disk. 

Installing
Herring is installed as gem.
    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install backtik-red-herring

Generating or Initializing
You can generate a new Herring structure with the herring command
    cd /path/to/some/folder
    herring some_name
  OR
You can initialize an existing directory with the --init option
    cd /path/to/some/herring/folder
    herring --init

Using
Herring runs atop Rack.  You can run Herring with Rack's rackup command. The default port is :9292

    cd /path/to/your/herring
    rackup
  
You can now request files from Herring in your web browser:

http://localhost:9292/folder/file.format

Herring will parse certain Ruby formats and return their equivalent standard web format:

http://localhost:9292/folder/pretty.sass
will return Sass shaped css 

http://localhost:9292/folder/behave.red
will return Red rendered javascript 

Wha? Why?
Herring lets you use Ruby generated resources in development regardless of production environment.
